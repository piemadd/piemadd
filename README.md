Hi! My name is Piero and I am a student programmer from Atlanta! I like to run, bike, swim, play video games, penetration test, and program in my free time. On this website you can see my social media, and some ways to contact me. If you would like a list of domains/websites under my holdings, you can email me. My email is at the bottom of the page where I am always open to receiving feedback!
